# READme Generator

## Description

This is a READme generator that creates a readme file after you run through a series of questions. It is supposed to help the user easily create a readme file. I learned how to use node and npms to create a generator and connect each file's content to one another. 


## Usage

1. Run npm init -y
2. Install npm inquirer@8.2.4
3. Run node index.js
4. Answer questions accordingly
5. README file is then generated
